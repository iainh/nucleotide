This is a simple GUI for [helix](https://helix-editor.com/) editor. Most modal editors are terminal apps, I'd like to change that and implement a good modal GUI editor.

## State of things
Currently this project has *less* features and more bugs than helix-term (`hx`).

* The first goal is to reach feature parity 
* Second goal is refactoring helix to allow for implementing commands properly
* Third goal is adding things like builtin terminal and file tree
