# Nucleotide Logging Implementation Todo

## Status: Planning Complete âœ…

### Completed Planning Tasks
- [x] Analyze current codebase logging patterns
- [x] Research tokio tracing architecture and best practices  
- [x] Design comprehensive logging solution architecture
- [x] Create detailed implementation plan with incremental steps
- [x] Generate step-by-step prompts for implementation
- [x] Create documentation files (future/logging.md, future/logging-prompts.md)

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation
- [ ] Step 1: Create nucleotide-logging crate
- [ ] Step 2: Implement configurable subscriber  
- [ ] Step 3: Update workspace dependencies
- [ ] Step 4: Basic integration test

### Phase 2: Core Migration  
- [ ] Step 5: Migrate nucleotide-core event bridges
- [ ] Step 6: Add editor operation instrumentation
- [ ] Step 7: Instrument LSP communication
- [ ] Step 8: Update error handling with context

### Phase 3: Application Integration
- [ ] Step 9: Main application startup integration
- [ ] Step 10: UI and workspace operation tracing
- [ ] Step 11: File operations instrumentation  
- [ ] Step 12: Performance monitoring and metrics

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- [ ] Step 13: Log-based debugging and diagnostics
- [ ] Step 14: Configuration management and runtime tuning
- [ ] Step 15: Development and production profiles
- [ ] Step 16: Documentation and best practices

## Key Deliverables

### Technical Components
- [ ] `nucleotide-logging` crate with layered subscriber architecture
- [ ] Structured tracing throughout all 7 workspace crates
- [ ] File logging to `~/.config/nucleotide/nucleotide.log`
- [ ] Console and JSON output options
- [ ] Performance monitoring and metrics
- [ ] Configuration management system

### Quality Assurance
- [ ] Zero performance regression (< 5% overhead target)
- [ ] Complete migration from `log::*` to `tracing::*` macros
- [ ] Comprehensive error context and debugging information
- [ ] Integration tests for all logging functionality
- [ ] Documentation and usage examples

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All log statements provide structured, searchable data
- [ ] Clear operation traces for debugging complex async workflows
- [ ] Configurable verbosity levels per component
- [ ] Production-ready logging with rotation and management
- [ ] Developer-friendly console output with readable formatting

## Next Steps
Ready to begin implementation with Step 1: Create nucleotide-logging crate.
Each step includes detailed requirements, implementation guidance, and testing criteria.
