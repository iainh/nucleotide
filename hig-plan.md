# Apple Human Interface Guidelines Integration Plan for Nucleotide-UI

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to integrate Apple's Human Interface Guidelines (HIG) principles into the nucleotide-ui crate, transforming it into a truly native macOS text editor experience. The plan focuses on foundational design principles, accessibility, visual design, and interaction patterns that align with macOS user expectations.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Architecture Strengths
- Strong component-based architecture with traits (Interactive, Styled, Composable)
- Design token system already in place with DesignTokens and Theme structures
- Event-driven architecture with proper separation of concerns
- Performance-oriented with virtualization and animation capabilities
- GPUI integration providing GPU-accelerated rendering

### Areas for HIG Alignment
- Typography system needs refinement for SF Pro integration
- Spacing and layout need standardization to HIG specifications
- Color system requires dynamic appearance support
- Navigation patterns need keyboard accessibility improvements
- Component interactions need haptic feedback integration
- Window management needs proper titlebar and toolbar alignment

## Design Principles (HIG Foundations)

### 1. Clarity (HIG: Foundations > Design Principles)
**Current Gap**: Component hierarchy and visual relationships could be clearer
**Target**: Clear visual hierarchy with consistent use of typography scales and spacing

### 2. Deference (HIG: Foundations > Design Principles)
**Current Gap**: UI may compete with content for attention
**Target**: Content-first design where UI elements defer to the text being edited

### 3. Depth (HIG: Foundations > Design Principles)
**Current Gap**: Limited use of elevation and layering
**Target**: Proper elevation system for modals, tooltips, and panels

```text
Implement SF Pro font family integration in the nucleotide-ui crate. Create a new typography module that provides semantic font scales following Apple's Dynamic Type guidelines.

Requirements:
1. Add SF Pro font loading with system font fallbacks
2. Create semantic typography scales (body, caption, headline, large title, etc.)  
3. Implement Dynamic Type scaling that responds to user accessibility preferences
4. Update the existing DesignTokens struct to include typography tokens
5. Create utility functions for applying typography styles to GPUI elements
6. Update the Theme struct to include typography configuration
7. Ensure all typography follows Apple's line height and letter spacing guidelines

The implementation should integrate with the existing design token system and provide backward compatibility with current text styling. Focus on creating a foundation that other components can build upon.

Test the implementation by updating the Button component to use the new typography system and verify it scales properly with accessibility settings.
```

### Prompt 2: Color System Overhaul

```text
Replace the current color system in nucleotide-ui with NSColor semantic colors that automatically adapt to light/dark mode and accessibility preferences.

Requirements:
1. Research and implement NSColor semantic color integration via GPUI
2. Create new SemanticColors struct with all standard macOS system colors
3. Implement automatic light/dark mode detection and switching
4. Add high contrast mode support using NSColor high contrast variants
5. Update DesignTokens to use semantic colors instead of hardcoded values
6. Integrate system accent color preferences
7. Ensure all colors meet WCAG AA contrast requirements
8. Create color utility functions for generating hover/active states

The implementation must maintain the existing Theme API for backward compatibility while internally using the new semantic color system. Update at least 3 components (Button, ListItem, and focus indicators) to demonstrate the new system.

Test across light mode, dark mode, and high contrast mode to verify proper adaptation.
```

### Prompt 3: Spacing and Grid System
