## Detailed Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Foundation Integration (Steps 1-4)

### Step 1: Update Library Exports and Fix Compilation Issues
**Scope**: Resolve missing exports and compilation errors to establish baseline
**Duration**: 1 iteration

**Tasks**:
- Add missing `advanced_theming` module to lib.rs exports
- Fix provider container Element trait implementation
- Resolve string lifetime and borrow checker issues  
- Add missing dependencies (dirs crate)
- Ensure all 89+ tests pass

**Integration Points**:
- Update `crates/nucleotide-ui/src/lib.rs` exports
- Fix provider system compilation errors
- Add proper trait implementations

**Prompt for Step 1**:
```
Fix compilation issues in the nucleotide-ui library to establish a clean baseline. Focus on:

1. Add missing `advanced_theming` module export to lib.rs
2. Fix ProviderContainer Element trait implementation issues  
3. Resolve string lifetime and borrow checker errors in provider system
4. Ensure the `dirs` dependency is properly added to Cargo.toml
5. Fix any remaining compilation errors to get all tests passing

The goal is to have a fully compiling nucleotide-ui library that exports all our enhanced components and systems. Don't make any integration changes yet - just fix the library itself.

Check compilation with `cargo test` and ensure all existing tests pass.
```

### Step 2: Initialize Enhanced UI System in Main Editor
**Scope**: Replace basic init() call with comprehensive system initialization
**Duration**: 1 iteration

**Tasks**:
- Update main.rs to call nucleotide-ui's enhanced init() function
- Initialize performance monitoring if enabled
- Setup component registry with all built-in components
- Initialize focus management system

**Integration Points**:
- Modify `crates/nucleotide/src/main.rs::gui_main()`
- Update initialization sequence before window creation
- Preserve existing theme manager initialization

**Prompt for Step 2**:
```
Integrate the enhanced nucleotide-ui initialization system into the main editor. 

In `crates/nucleotide/src/main.rs`, update the `gui_main()` function to:

1. Call `nucleotide_ui::init(cx, Some(ui_config))` early in the GPUI app setup
2. Setup a proper UIConfig with performance monitoring enabled in debug mode
3. Initialize the component registry with all built-in components
4. Initialize the focus management system for keyboard navigation
5. Preserve the existing theme manager setup but prepare it for future enhancement

The initialization should happen before window creation but after the GPUI app is set up. Ensure backward compatibility - existing functionality should work unchanged.
```

### Step 3: Integrate Design Token System
**Scope**: Replace hardcoded theme values with design tokens throughout UI components
**Duration**: 2 iterations

**Tasks**:
- Update existing UI components to use DesignTokens instead of raw Hsla values
- Migrate theme_manager.rs to use token-based themes
- Update workspace, titlebar, and other UI elements to use semantic colors
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing theme structure

**Integration Points**:
- Update `ThemeManager` to bridge between Helix themes and design tokens
- Modify all `div()` style calls to use `theme.tokens.colors.*`
- Update component rendering in workspace, file tree, overlays

**Prompt for Step 3A**:
```
Begin integrating the design token system into existing UI components. Focus on the core theme management:

1. Update the existing `ThemeManager` in the main editor to bridge between Helix themes and nucleotide-ui design tokens
2. Modify the theme creation/setup in `main.rs` to use `Theme::from_tokens()` method
3. Update 3-4 core UI components (like workspace background, titlebar) to use `theme.tokens.colors.*` instead of hardcoded `theme.background` etc.
4. Ensure the legacy theme fields are still populated for backward compatibility

Focus on establishing the pattern without breaking existing functionality. The goal is to prove the integration works before doing a full migration.
```

**Prompt for Step 3B**:
```
Complete the design token integration across all UI components:

1. Update all remaining UI components (file tree, overlays, notifications, picker, completion) to use design tokens
2. Replace all hardcoded `Hsla` color values with semantic token references
3. Update any component styling that uses direct theme field access to use `theme.tokens.*`
4. Test that theme switching still works and all visual elements use consistent colors

Ensure visual consistency is maintained - the app should look identical but now use the systematic design token approach.
```

### Step 4: Implement Provider Foundation
**Scope**: Setup provider hierarchy for configuration and theme management
**Duration**: 2 iterations

**Tasks**:
- Initialize provider system in main application startup
- Setup ThemeProvider to wrap existing theme management

**Integration Points**:
- Wrap workspace creation with provider components
- Setup global provider context in main window creation
- Integrate with existing theme and config management

**Prompt for Step 4A**:
```
Implement the foundation of the provider system in the main editor:

1. Initialize the provider system in the main window creation
2. Setup a ThemeProvider that wraps the existing theme management 
3. Create a basic ConfigurationProvider for UI settings
