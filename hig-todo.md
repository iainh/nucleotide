## Notes

- Each chunk should be implemented incrementally with testing at each step
- Dependencies between chunks must be respected to avoid integration issues
- Regular user feedback should be collected throughout the implementation
- Performance monitoring should be continuous to catch regressions early
- All accessibility features must be tested with real users where possible
